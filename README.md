## Tic-Tac-Toe With AI
This is my first attempt at creating an AI using the minimax algorithm. 
Upon launching the game you are faced with an AI that is impossible to beat. 
You can modify the difficulty of the game using the dropdown button that appears 
upon completion of the first game. Each difficulty is mapped to an integer that 
represents the maximum depth the minimax algorithm can reach before terminating. Therefore, harder 
difficulties are mapped to larger maximum depths so the AI can analyse and reach the best possible outcome.

## Running The Game
This project requires Java 11.0.4 or above, and Gradle 5.6.1 or above.<br>
To run the application, navigate to the root of the project folder and
execute gradle run in a terminal.
